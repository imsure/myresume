University of Arizona

Took courses on all aspects of Computer Science: from theory, systems
to applications. Worked as TA for CS460: Database Systems and RA for
ANTARES (https://www.noao.edu/ANTARES/) project, where I was involved
in building and researching high performance data processing pipeline
for astronomical data in collaboration with astronomers at NOAO.


University of St. Thomas

Took courses on all aspects of Software Engineering, with a focus on
Big Data technology. Worked on the project "Large-scale Neural Network
Modeling with Hadoop" (http://imsure.github.io/NeuralGiraph/) to
explore the use of big data technologies in computational neuroscience
and I was responsible for investigating graph processing in Hadoop.


Why do you want to work at LeetCode?

LeetCode helps me improve my problem solving and coding skills
significantly, it is something that you don't get to learn in
school. I want to work at LeetCode because it matters, because it is
highly impactful.


Describe a project that you did? (Please include links to the relevant
projects if available)

I once worked on a project called "Large-scale Neural Modeling in
MapReduce and Giraph" where we used Hadoop to implement a large scale
basal ganglia neural network model in MapReduce and Giraph. I was
responsible for researching the graph processing in Hadoop and all the
implementations. The link to the project:
