%	LETTER CONTENT
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}

  \lettersection{About Me}
  State why you are writing; how you learned of the organization or
  position, and basic information about yourself.

  \lettersection{Why this Company?}
  Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the
  employer does (Simply stating that you are interested does not tell
  why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know
  enough about the employer or position to relate your background to
  the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make
  you a good fit for the company's needs. (Focus on what you can do
  for the employer, not what employer can do for you). This is an
  opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your
  resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed. Mention
  other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position. 

  \lettersection{Why Me?}
  Indicate that you would like the opportunity to interview for a
  position or to talk with the employer to learn more about their
  opportunities or hiring plans. State what you would do to follow
  up, such as telephone the employer within two weeks. If you will be
  in the employer's location and could offer to schedule a visit,
  indicate when. State that you would be glad to provide the employer
  with any additional information needed. Thank the employer for
  her/his consideration.
